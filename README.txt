The .RMD file code will not run in its current form. I have added the eval=FALSE flag in the chunk to make the code not run when executed. This is because the ggsave() function is incompatible with GitHub pages, and will cause errors, but it will work on your local machine if you copy the code.

Example code of how to use this function and a more detailed explanation of the package can be found at my github repository link:
